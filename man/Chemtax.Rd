\title{An overdetermined linear inverse problem: estimating algal composition based on pigment biomarkers}
\description{Input files for assessing the algal composition of a field sample,
based on the pigment composition of the algal groups (measured in the laboratory) and the pigment composition of the field sample.  

In the example there are 8 types of \bold{algae}: 
\item (*) Prasinophytes
\item (*) Dinoflagellates
\item (*) Cryptophytes
\item (*) Haptophytes type 3 (Hapto3s)
\item (*) Haptophytes type 4 (Hapto4s)
\item (*) Chlorophytes
\item (*) Cynechococcus
\item (*) Diatoms

and 12 \bold{pigments}:
\cr \code{Perid} = Peridinin, 
\code{19But} = 19-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, 
\code{Fucox} = fucoxanthin, 
\cr \code{19Hex} = 19-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, 
\code{Neo} = neoxanthin, 
\code{Pras} = prasinoxanthin, 
\cr \code{Viol} = violaxanthin, 
\code{Allox} = alloxanthin, 
\code{Lutein} = lutein, 
\cr \code{Zeax} = zeaxanthin, 
\code{Chlb} = chlorophyll b,               
\code{Chla} = chlorophyll a


The input data consist of: 
\item 1. the pigment composition of the various algal groups, for instance determined from cultures (the Southern Ocean example -table 4- in Mackey et al., 1996) 
\item 2. the pigment composition of a field sample.

Based on these data, the algal composition of the field sample is estimated, 
under the assumption that the pigment composition of the field sample is a weighted avertage of the pigment
composition of algae present in the sample, where weighting is proportional to their biomass.

As there are more measurements (12 pigments) than unknowns (8 algae), the resulting linear system is overdetermined.
\cr It is thus solved in a least squares sense (using function \code{lsei}):

 \deqn{\min(||Ax-b||^2)} subject to        
 \deqn{Ex=f}
 \deqn{Gx>=h}

If there are 2 algae \code{A,B}, and 3 pigments \code{1,2,3} then the 3 approximate equalities (\eqn{A*x=B})would  be:
 \deqn{f[1,S] = p[A]*f[A,1]+p[B]*f[B,1]}
 \deqn{f[2,S] = p[A]*f[A,2]+p[B]*f[B,3]}
 \deqn{f[3,S] = p[A]*f[A,3]+p[B]*f[B,3]}

where \eqn{p[A]} and \eqn{p[b]} are the (unknown) proportions of algae A and B in the field sample (S), and 
\eqn{f[A,1]} is the relative amount of pigment 1 in alga A, etc...

The equality ensures that the sum of fractions equals 1:
 \deqn{1 = p[A]+p[b]}


and the inequalities ensure that fractions are positive numbers
\deqn{p[A] > 0}
\deqn{p[B] > 0}}
\usage{Chemtax}
\format{A list with the input ratio matrix (\code{Ratio}) and a vector with the field data (\code{Field})
\item The input ratio matrix \code{Ratio} contains the pigment compositions (columns) for each algal group (rows); 
the compositions are scaled relative to \code{Chla} (last column).
\item  The vector with the \code{Field} data contains the pigment composition of a sample in the field, also scaled relative to \code{Chla}; 
the pigments are similarly ordened as for the input ratio matrix.

The rownames of matrix \code{Ratio} are the algal group names, columnames of \code{Ratio} (=names of \code{Field}) are the pigments}
