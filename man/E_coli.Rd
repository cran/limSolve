\description{
  Input matrices and vectors for performing Flux Balance Analysis of the
  E.coli metabolism

  (as from \url{http://gcrg.ucsd.edu/Downloads/Flux_Balance_Analysis}).

  There are 53 substances:

  GLC, G6P, F6P, FDP, T3P2, T3P1, 13PDG, 3PG, 2PG, PEP, PYR, ACCOA, CIT, ICIT,
  AKG, SUCCOA, SUCC, FUM, MAL, OA, ACTP, ETH, AC, LAC, FOR, D6PGL, D6PGC, RL5P,
  X5P, R5P, S7P, E4P, RIB, GLX, NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH, HEXT, Q, FAD, FADH,
  AMP, ADP, ATP, GL3P, CO2, PI, PPI, O2, COA, GL, QH2

  and 13 externals:

  Biomass, GLCxt, GLxt, RIBxt, ACxt, LACxt, FORxt, ETHxt, SUCCxt, PYRxt,
  PIxt, O2xt, CO2xt


  There are 70 unknown reactions (named by the gene encoding for it):

  GLK1,  PGI1,  PFKA,  FBP, FBA, TPIA, GAPA, PGK, GPMA, ENO, PPSA, PYKA,
  ACEE, ZWF, PGL, GND, RPIA, RPE, TKTA1, TKTA2, TALA, GLTA, ACNA, ICDA,
  SUCA, SUCC1, SDHA1, FRDA, FUMA, MDH, DLD1, ADHE2, PFLA, PTA, ACKA, ACS,
  PCKA, PPC, MAEB, SFCA, ACEA, ACEB, PPA, GLPK, GPSA1, RBSK, NUOA, FDOH,
  GLPD, CYOA, SDHA2, PNT1A, PNT2A, ATPA, GLCUP, GLCPTS, GLUP, RIBUP, ACUP,
  LACUP, FORUP, ETHUP, SUCCUP, PYRUP, PIUP, O2TX, CO2TX, ATPM, ADK, Growth

  The \code{lsei} model contains:
  \itemize{
    \item 54 equalities (Ax=B): the 53 mass balances (one for each substance)
      and one equation that sets the ATP drain flux for constant maintenance
      requirements to a fixed value (5.87)
   \item 70 unknowns (x), the reaction rates
   \item 62 inequalities (Gx>h). The first 28 inequalities impose bounds
     on some reactions.
     The last 34 inequalities impose that the reaction rates have to be
     positive (for unidirectional reactions only).
   \item 1 function that has to be maximised, the biomass production (growth).
  }
  As there are more unknowns (70) than equations (54), there exist an
  infinite amount of solutions (it is an underdetermined problem).
}

\usage{E_coli}

\format{
  A list with the matrices and vectors that constitute the mass balance problem:
  \code{A}, \code{B}, \code{G} and \code{H} and

  \code{Maximise}, with the function to maximise.

  The columnames of \code{A} and \code{G} are the names of the unknown
  reaction rates;
  The first 53 rownames of \code{A} give the names of the components
  (these rows consitute the mass balance equations).
